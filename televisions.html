        <h2>A family's choice : Bigger or Smaller </h2>
        <br>
        
        <p>It’s a Friday night, and the Sharma family is gathered in their favorite electronics store, marveling at the dazzling wall of televisions. Young Aryan, fascinated by the colossal 85-inch OLED display, tugs at his dad’s sleeve.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Dad, we have to get this one! It’s huge!” </p>
    <br>
    <p>His father chuckles but hesitates. “It’s definitely impressive, but have you thought about how much power it will consume?” </p>
    <br>
    <p>Aryan’s mom, an energy-conscious consumer, pulls out her phone and starts comparing the energy ratings. “A bigger screen often means higher power consumption,” she explains. “But let’s see what the data says.” </p>

        <h2>Why Does it Matter?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>With rising electricity costs and growing environmental concerns, understanding how screen size impacts power usage is crucial. While a larger screen provides a better viewing experience, it may also come with a hidden cost—higher energy consumption. The question is: Is there a trade-off between entertainment and sustainability?</p>
       <br>
       <p>To answer this, let’s analyze real-world data and visualize how screen size correlates with power consumption and energy efficiency ratings.</p>

        <h2>Lets Look at Statistics</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/stat1.png" alt="Stat Image">

       <p>This is the number of TV sreensizes available and used in  Australia</p>
       <br>
       <p><ul>Small TVs (32-40 inches) generally consume between 50-70W.</ul>
        <ul>Mid-range TVs (40-55 inches) consume 80-120W.</ul>
            <ul>Large TVs (65 inches and above) can go beyond 200W, significantly increasing household energy consumption..</ul>
    </p>
        <br>
        <p>Larger the screensize more power it comsume. Lets look at the graph below</p>

        <p>Lets look a bar chart to see the differnce in comsumption</p>
