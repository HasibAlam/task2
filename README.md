The use of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, played a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and accuracy during the development of this project. AI was utilized primarily for coding assistance, debugging, and refining CSS and HTML structures to improve the websiteâ€™s visual appeal and functionality. It helped in generating a gradient background, ensuring the footer was properly positioned, and adding hover effects for better user interaction. Additionally, ChatGPT assisted in formatting placeholder content, ensuring clarity and coherence in presenting statistical data on energy consumption. By providing recommendations on CSS properties, AI contributed to a more accessible and user-friendly design.

Beyond coding, ChatGPT also supported academic writing by refining documentation, structuring explanations, and improving overall readability. Its ability to streamline content structuring and enhance clarity was particularly useful in organizing technical discussions. The integration of AI in this project significantly improved efficiency by accelerating development time, reducing errors, and ensuring a clean, well-structured codebase. However, while AI served as a valuable tool, human oversight remained essential to validate and refine its outputs, ensuring the final product met academic and technical standards.
